## Fitment Compatibility

Please be aware that vehicle radio slot dimensions can vary significantly between:
- Different vehicle manufacturers
- Different model years
- Different trim levels of the same model
- Factory modifications and updates

While we strive to provide accurate measurements and fitment information, we cannot guarantee that this open-source radio design will fit every vehicle. Always carefully measure your vehicle's radio slot dimensions before beginning installation.

## Material Requirements and Safety Considerations

### Temperature Resistance

Vehicle interiors can reach extremely high temperatures, especially when parked in direct sunlight. For safety and durability:

- ABS plastic is strongly recommended as the primary material for all 3D-printed components
- PLA is NOT recommended due to its low heat deflection temperature
- Consider using high-temperature grade ABS for additional safety margin
- Test all printed components for heat resistance before installation

### Material Safety Warning

DO NOT use:
- Magnetic filaments
- Electrically conductive filaments
- Metal-filled filaments
- Carbon fiber filaments with >20% carbon fiber content

Carbon fiber usage notes:
- Low percentage (<15%) carbon fiber filaments may be used for non-critical components
- Avoid using any carbon fiber parts near circuit boards or antenna connections
- Test conductivity of printed parts before installation if using carbon fiber
- Consider moisture exposure as it can increase conductivity of carbon fiber parts

### Additional Safety Notes

1. Ensure proper ventilation around the radio unit to prevent overheating
2. Regular inspection of printed components for signs of heat stress or deformation
3. Consider ambient temperature conditions in your geographic location
