# Car-Pi

## About
Car Pi is an open source radio for older cars. Most replacement car radios are either very expensive, or they are missing android auto or a backup camera. With Car Pi, you can get all of these features for around $100-$150 including all of the parts needed.

## Installation
Notice: It is highly recommended that you are comfortable with the Linux command line, car modding, and just general Raspberry Pi stuff.

Parts Needed:
- Rapberry pi (I would recommend a pi 3B+ or a pi4B a pi 5 is overkil)
- A 16 gig. micro sd card
- Touch Screen (5 in. to 7 in. display depending on the car.)
- Sound Board (Explained below)
- 3d printer or access to a 3d printer
